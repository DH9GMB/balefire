## Throttling
**Throttling** is a technique used by internet service providers (ISPs) or authorities to **intentionally slow down** the internet connection for specific websites, services, or users.

### How Throttling Works:

1. **Detection**: The ISP detects traffic going to or coming from certain websites or services.
2. **Rate Limiting**: The ISP reduces the speed at which data is transmitted to and from these sites.
3. **Impact**: Users experience slower loading times, buffering, or reduced quality of service when accessing throttled content.

### Why Throttling is Used:

- **Control Access**: To make it difficult or frustrating to access certain websites or services.
- **Bandwidth Management**: To manage network resources more effectively during peak times or with heavy usage.

### Simple Example:

- **Streaming Video**: You try to watch a high-definition video on a streaming service.
- **Throttling Applied**: The ISP slows down your internet speed specifically for that streaming service.
- **Effect**: The video buffers often or plays in lower resolution.

### Purpose of Throttling in Censorship:

- **Limit Content Consumption**: Discourages users from accessing or consuming large amounts of information from particular sites or services.
- **Compliance**: Forces users to comply with regulatory or governmental guidelines by making it inconvenient to access prohibited content.

### Detection and Circumvention:

- **VPNs**: Virtual Private Networks can sometimes help bypass throttling by masking the type of traffic.
- **Performance Monitoring Tools**: Users can employ tools to detect if their connection is being throttled and report it.

### Key Points to Remember:

- **Selective**: Throttling targets specific websites, services, or types of content.
- **Intentional**: It is a deliberate action, not due to technical issues.
- **User Experience**: Aimed at degrading the user experience to discourage access.

By reducing internet speeds for targeted content, throttling serves as a subtle yet effective method of controlling what users can easily access online.
