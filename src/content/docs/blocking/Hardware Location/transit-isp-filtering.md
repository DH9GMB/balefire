**Transit ISP Filtering** refers to the practice of intermediate ISPs (those that carry data across different networks) monitoring and controlling the flow of internet traffic passing through their infrastructure.

### Key Points:

- **Intermediate Nodes**: Applied by ISPs that transport data between different endpoints.
- **Filtering Criteria**: Uses similar methods such as IP addresses, URLs, or content types.
- **Data Flow Control**: Manages and restricts access to certain data moving through the network.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures adherence to censorship laws even while data is in transit.

### Purpose:

- **Content Regulation**: Enforces governmental or organizational policies on data transmission.
- **Security**: Protects networks from illegal or harmful content traversing through them.

Transit ISP Filtering is essential for regulating and censoring internet traffic not just at the endpoints but also as it travels through various networks.
