**ISP Inner Filtering** refers to the methods Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use internally to control and restrict access to certain content on the internet as mandated by government regulations or their own policies.

### Key Points:

- **Traffic Monitoring**: ISPs monitor user traffic.
- **Content Blocking**: Specific websites or services are blocked.
- **Keyword Filtering**: Certain keywords trigger censorship mechanisms.
- **Compliance**: Ensures adherence to legal requirements.

### Purpose:

- **Restrict Access**: Prevents users from accessing prohibited content.
- **Maintain Control**: Helps governments or authorities maintain control over the information flow.

ISP Inner Filtering is a core component of how internet censorship is implemented, restricting or blocking access at the network level.
