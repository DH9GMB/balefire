## IP Blackhole/Redirection

IP blackholing and redirection are techniques used by governments or network administrators to block access to certain online content. Here's a simple explanation of each:

### IP Blackholing

**IP Blackholing** involves dropping all traffic destined for specific IP addresses, effectively making those addresses unreachable.

#### How It Works:
1. **Identify Target IPs**: Authorities determine the IP addresses of websites they want to censor.
2. **Routing Decision**: Network routers are configured to drop any packets going to these target IPs.
3. **No Response**: When a user tries to visit a censored website, their requests are sent to a "black hole" â€” there is no response, as if the site doesn't exist.

#### Simple Example:
- **Before Censorship**: Your computer sends a request to an IP address like `192.168.1.1` to access a website.
- **After Blackholing**: The router drops packets to `192.168.1.1`, so your request disappears into the void and the site doesn't load.

### IP Redirection

**IP Redirection** involves redirecting web traffic intended for certain IP addresses to other locations, which could be a warning page or an unrelated website.

#### How It Works:
1. **Target IPs Identified**: Authorities select the IP addresses to be censored.
2. **Modify Routing Tables**: Routers are instructed to redirect these IP addresses to alternative IPs.
3. **User Redirection**: Users attempting to visit a blocked site are taken to a different page.

#### Simple Example:
- **Blocked Site**: You try to access `192.168.1.1`.
- **Redirected**: Instead of reaching `192.168.1.1`, you're redirected to `192.168.1.100`, which might display a message like "This site is blocked."

### Purpose of These Techniques

- **Control Access**: Prevent users from reaching specific websites deemed undesirable or unsafe.
- **Information Control**: Restrict the availability of certain information.
- **Security Reasons**: Protect networks from malicious websites or content.
