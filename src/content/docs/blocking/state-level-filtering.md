## State-Level Filtering

**State-Level Filtering** is the practice where a government or state enforces restrictions on internet content accessible within its borders.

### Key Points:

- **Scope**: Can apply to websites, social media, messaging apps, and more.
- **Techniques**:
  - **DNS Blocking**: Prevents domain name resolution for specific sites.
  - **IP Blocking**: Blocks access to certain IP addresses.
  - **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)**: Analyzes and filters data packets based on content.
- **Purpose**:
  - **Political Control**: Restricts access to politically sensitive information.
  - **Cultural Control**: Blocks material deemed inappropriate or harmful.

State-Level Filtering is a powerful tool used by governments to control the information environment within their jurisdictions.
