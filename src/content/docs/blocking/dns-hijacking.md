## DNS Hijacking

DNS hijacking can also be used by governments or organizations as a tool for internet censorship. In this context, it involves altering the DNS settings to control access to certain websites.

Here's how it works:

1. **Control Over DNS**: Authorities gain control over the DNS servers that users rely on to translate domain names into IP addresses.

2. **Blocking Access**:
   - Certain websites (e.g., social media, news portals, or other restricted content) are targeted.
   - Instead of translating the domain name to the correct IP address, the DNS server returns an incorrect IP address or a message saying the site is blocked.

3. **Redirection**: Users trying to visit censored websites are either redirected to:
   - A government page explaining that the site is blocked.
   - An unrelated or deceptive site.

### Simple Example

Imagine you're in a country where access to "www.socialmedia.com" is restricted:

- You type "www.socialmedia.com" in your browser.
- Normally, the DNS server translates this to the website's real IP address.
- With DNS hijacking for censorship, the DNS server returns an error or directs you to a different page stating that access is prohibited.
